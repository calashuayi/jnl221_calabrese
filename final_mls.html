<h1 class="center-text">The Messi Effect</h1>
<h2 class="center-text">(and how MLS teams are making the most of it)</h2>

<div class="article-text">
  <p>“I’ve made the decision that I am going to go to Miami.”</p>
  <p>Lionel Messi spoke those words in an interview with the Spanish media on June 7th, 2023, marking the start of a new era for American soccer. It was a moment that turned Inter Miami and all of Major League Soccer on its head.</p>
  <p>The one-year anniversary of that historic day is now fast approaching, and the “Messi Effect” is now in full swing. Inter Miami is now a globally recognized brand bringing millions of new eyes to MLS, and the league is breaking new records every week. In fact, the level to which Messi has changed everything for American soccer in such a short period of time is truly precedented, and would have seemed unfathomable just twelve months ago.</p>
  <p>“The amount of interest in-bound commercially and sporting-side is far beyond what I think any of us could have imagined,” <a href="https://theathletic.com/4707241/2023/07/21/jorge-mas-messi-miami/">Miami owner Jorge Mas told reporters last year</a>. “Leo Messi is probably the greatest ambassador in this league’s history.”</p>

  <p>Before Mas brought the now-eight-time Ballon d’Or winner stateside last summer, his Miami team was undoubtedly among the least desirable in MLS. On the field, the Herons sat at the bottom of the Western Conference. Off of it, they played before small crowds and, at times, had tickets priced lower than a McDonalds meal. In fact, tickets for Miami’s last game prior to Messi’s announcement, against D.C. United on June 3rd, cost as low as $9 according to ticket reseller TickPick.</p>
  <p>Then, in the blink of an eye, everything flipped on its head. Messi’s Miami debut – a Leagues Cup showdown with Mexican powerhouse Cruz Azul – not only brought in a sold-out crowd; Fans had to shell out in excess of $200 just to get in the door, with many seats costing prices in the thousands. The man of the hour delivered, too, scoring a peach of a walk-off winning goal from a signature free kick, handing Miami a thrilling 2-1 win with the eyes of the world watching.</p>

  <p>“So now, we’re at our downtown office and we asked ourselves, how can we make this about us?” recalls Rudy Hodgson, the Chicago Fire’s Coordinator of Sporting Communications. “He's not coming to us, but how can we make it about us?”</p>

  <p>In an increasingly social media-driven world, front offices around MLS had to ask themselves that same question. For the Chicago Fire, a middle-of-the-pack Eastern Conference team seeking relevance both in MLS as well as in its own market, the prospect of having arguably the greatest player of all time in their league represented a huge opportunity.</p>
  <p>The arrival of Messi kicked off a countdown for Hodgson and the Fire. Miami had been scheduled to travel to Soldier Field on October 4th of that season, giving the front office nearly four months to prepare for what would be, for many, one of the biggest games in the club’s history. In that span, the Fire could wait and see what other teams did well and poorly to create the best possible experience for fans that could encourage them to come back.</p>

  </div>

  <p>As Miami and Chicago are both in the Eastern Conference, they play each other twice every season, once at each team’s home venue. Miami will visit Soldier Field again on August 31st of this year, with Messi scheduled to play barring another injury, so once again, the Fire must prepare to put on a show as they seek to put themselves on the market in a sports city where they are typically far from the center of attention.</p>
  <p>“It's great that all these people are coming to ultimately watch Messi,” Hodgson said. “But how can we get those Messi fans in Chicago to become Chicago Fire fans in Chicago?”</p>
  <p>He quipped that the homegrown, MLS-bred local talent can prove to be a draw of its own.</p>
  <p>“The biggest thing that I've noticed is people are buying in more and more around the Chicagoland talent. The biggest roars get are for [Chris] Brady and [Brian Gutiérrez].”</p>
  <p>“You come for Messi but you're kind of leaving with, ‘oh man, Guti is actually really, really good… we should pull for him when Messi is gone,’ because there is gonna be a day, and I think it's sooner than we think, where he's not gonna be around anymore.”</p>
